Package Manager
===============

In Alice, theres two package manager used, [spm](https://codeberg.org/emmett1/spm) and [autils](https://codeberg.org/emmett1/autils). Why two package manager? `spm` was written for generic package manager for linux distribution. And `autils` is written specifically for `Alice` and required `spm`.

spm
---

`spm` stands for `simple package manager`. It does simple and minimal written in POSIX compliance shell script. It only depends on core utils and tar (or busybox's utils and tar). `spm` only intended for compressing some directory into package, then extract package into system with files being tracked into database. Theres is no build script, recipe or ports in `spm`. You can write your own tools to use with `spm` either like Arch Linux's `makepkg`, CRUX's `pkgmk` or Slackware's `slackbuild` script.

spm - usage
-----------

list `spm` usage:

	-a         print all installed packages
	-b <path>  build <path> directory into package
	-h         print this help message
	-i <file>  install <file> package into system
	-l <pkg>   list files installed by <pkg>
	-o <file>  print owner of <file>
	-r <name>  remove installed <name> from system
	-u <pkg>   re-install/upgrade <pkg>

list all install package with version:

	$ spm -a
	...
	neofetch 7.1.0-1
	nettle 3.10-1
	nghttp2 1.62.1-1
	ninja 1.12.1-1
	nodejs 22.5.1-1
	nspr 4.35-1
	nss 3.102.1-1
	nsxiv 32-1
	...

build package from directory:

	(build package)
	$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
	$ make
	
	(install into fake directory)
	$ make DESTDIR=$PWD/fakeroot install
	
	(turn fake directory into package (package.spm))
	# spm -b $PWD/fakeroot 
	
	(mv 'package.spm' into correct format (name#version-release.spm))
	# mv package.spm pkgname#pkgversion-pkgrelease.spm
	
	(install package into system)
	# spm -i pkgname#pkgversion-pkgrelease.spm

install package into system:

	# spm -i pkgname#pkgversion-pkgrelease.spm
	[pkgname] Verify package...
	[pkgname] Checking for conflicts...
	[pkgname] Installing package...
	[pkgname] Package 'pkgname#pkgversion-pkgrelease' installed.

list files installed by 'packagename'$ spm -l test:

	usr/
	usr/share/
	usr/share/aaa
	usr/bin/
	usr/bin/aaa

list package owner of a file (can use regex):

	$ spm -o gcc$
	ccache usr/lib/ccache/gcc
	gcc usr/bin/gcc
	gcc usr/bin/x86_64-pc-linux-musl-gcc
	linux lib/modules/6.6.41-Alice/build/scripts/dummy-tools/gcc

upgrade/reinstall installed package:

	# spm -u pkgname#pkgversion-pkgrelease.spm
	[pkgname] Verify package...
	[pkgname] Checking for conflicts...
	[pkgname] Upgrading package...
	[pkgname] Package 'pkgname#pkgversion-pkgrelease' upgraded.

spm - environment
-----------------

|env|description|
|---|---|
|SPM\_ROOT|use custom root location for package installation|
|SPM\_FORCEINSTALL|set any value to ignore conflicted files|

You can pass these environment to `spm` command, example:

	# SPM_ROOT=/mnt/rootfs spm -i pkgname#pkgversion-pkgrelease.spm
	# SPM_FORCEINSTALL=1 SPM_ROOT=/mnt/rootfs spm -i pkgname#pkgversion-pkgrelease.spm

autils
------

`autils` stands for `alice utilitis`. `autils` contains main package manager (apkg), utilities (apkg-\<util\>) and \<random util script\>. `autils` is specifically written to manage `Alice` packages.

apkg
----

`apkg` is a main package manager that can solve dependencies, batch install/upgrade/remove packages, system upgrades, trigger necessary caches, and etc. `apkg` can be run inside or outside package template.

When running outside package template, `apkg` will need 'package names' as arguments, and those 'package names' will search through `APKG_REPO` environment. Example:

	# apkg testpkg testpkg2 (build testpkg and testpkg2)
	# apkg testpkg testpkg2 -i (build and install testpkg and testpkg2)
	# apkg -u testpkg testpkg2 (upgrade/reinstall testpkg and testpkg2)
	# apkg -f -u testpkg testpkg2 (force rebuild then upgrade/reinstall testpkg and testpkg2)

When running inside package template, `apkg` will do operation for current directory package. Example:

	# cd /path/to/local/testpkg
	# apkg (build testpkg)
	# apkg -i (build and install testpkg)
	# apkg -u (upgrade/reinstall testpkg)
	# apkg -u -f (force rebuild then upgrade/reinstall testpkg)

apkg - usage
------------

	-i <pkg(s)>  install package(s)
	-I <pkg(s)>  install packages(s) with dependencies
	-d <pkg>     list <pkg> dependencies
	-D <pkg(s)>  list all dependencies
	-j <pkg>     list all dependents
	-u <pkg(s)>  upgrade package(s)
	-t [pkg(s)]  trigger system cache/db updates
	-U           update system
	-f           force rebuild
	-o <pkg(s)>  download source
	-p <pkg>     print package path
	-s <pattern> search packages
	-h           print this help message

I won't explain details on every each options here, but I will give quick tips/tricks to use `apkg`

installing package and its dependencies (mind the uppercase `i`):

	# apkg -I sway
	[...] Solving dependencies...
	[...] Installing 3 package(s):  mesa pango sway
	[...] Press ENTER to continue operation.
	[...] Press Ctrl + C to abort.

search available packages:

	$ apkg -s sway
	swaybg
	swaylock
	sway
	swayidle
	swayfx

install all package with 'sway' name and its dependencies:

	# apkg -I $(apkg -s sway)
	...
	[...] Package 'mesa' is installed
	[...] Package 'swaybg' is installed
	[...] Package 'swaylock' is installed
	[...] Package 'swayidle' is installed
	[...] Package 'swayfx' is installed
	[...] Solving dependencies...
	[...] Installing 2 package(s):  pango sway
	[...] Press ENTER to continue operation.
	[...] Press Ctrl + C to abort.

install package without solving dependencies (mind the lowercase `i` and theres no prompt for this option):

	# apkg -i wlroots mesa
	[...] Package 'wlroots' already installed.
	[...] Package 'mesa' already installed.

list all installed packages:

	$ apkg -a
	...
	qemu
	ranger
	rdfind
	readline
	rsync
	rtorrent
	rust
	...

list all installed packages with filter (will only print installed package contains word filter):

	$ apkg -a sway
	swaybg
	swayfx
	swayidle
	swaylock

list dependencies of a package:

	$ apkg -d sway
	wlroots
	json-c
	pango

list all dependencies tree of package(s):

	$ apkg -D sway dwm
	...
	wayland
	wayland-protocols
	xkeyboard-config
	xcb-proto
	xorgproto
	util-macros
	...

upgrade/reinstall package(s):

	# apkg -u wlroots cwm pango
	[wlroots] Verify package...
	[wlroots] Checking for conflicts...
	[wlroots] Upgrading package...
	[wlroots] Package 'wlroots#0.17.4-1' upgraded.
	[cwm] Verify package...
	[cwm] Checking for conflicts...
	[cwm] Upgrading package...
	[cwm] Package 'cwm#7.4-1' upgraded.
	[pango] Verify package...
	[pango] Checking for conflicts...
	[pango] Upgrading package...
	[pango] Package 'pango#1.54.0-1' upgraded.

full system upgrades (mind uppercase `u` and will prompt first if theres package updates):

	# apkg -U
	[...] Checking for outdated packages...
	[...] Solving dependencies...
	[...] Upgrading 3 package(s):  initscripts mesa sowm
	[...] Press ENTER to continue operation.
	[...] Press Ctrl + C to abort.

make full system rebuild in dependencies order (`-f`: force rebuild, `-u`: upgrade/reinstall, `-D`: solve dependency order, `-a`: list all installed package(s)):

	# apkg -f -u $(apkg -D $(apkg -a))
...
(start rebuilding package in dependencies order here)
...

remove installed packages:

	# apkg -r wlroots pango sway
	[...] Package 'wlroots' removed.
	[...] Package 'pango' removed.
	[...] Package 'sway' removed.

print package path:

	$ apkg -p sway
	/home/emmett/codeberg/alicelinux/repos/wayland/sway

apkg - environment
------------------

You can pass environment to `apkg` to override defaults and in `/etc/apkg.conf`. Available environment and its default value as follows:

|env|default value|description|
|-|-|-|
|APKG\_ROOT|/|root for package installation|
|APKG\_CONF|/etc/apkg.conf|apkg's config file|
|APKG\_REPO| |defaults is empty, template repo path, space separated variable|
|APKG\_PACKAGE\_DIR|$PWD|prebuilt package directory path|
|APKG\_SOURCE\_DIR|$PWD|package source directory path|
|APKG\_WORK\_DIR|$PWD|package working directory path|
|APKG\_NOPROMPT| |skip prompt, use any value|

You can add these environment into `apkg` config file.

/etc/apkg.conf
------------------

`apkg` can work without its config file by using all default value. Default config path for `apkg` is `/etc/apkg.conf`. You can override config path by append `APKG_CONF` to `apkg`, example:
	# APKG_CONF=/etc/apkg-local.conf apkg <args>

revdep
------

`revdep` is script to find broken packages. Its recomended to run after packages is removed or upgraded.

Usage:

	(print out broken packages)
	$ revdep
	
	(verbosely print missing libraries)
	$ revdep -v

You can combine with `apkg` to rebuild broken packages, example;

	# apkg -f -u $(revdep)
	
> NOTE: `revdep` does not solve dependencies, so you might need manually rebuild broken packages instead combine with `apkg`.

updateconf
----------

`updateconf` is script to update configuration files inside `/etc` directory. Its recomended to run after packages upgrades.

apkg-chroot
-----------
Script to entering chroot environment of custom root location.

	# apkg-chroot <customroot path>
	# apkg-chroot <customroot path> <command>

apkg-clean
----------
Print out old package and source caches.

Options:

	-s  print sources only
	-p  print packages only

Usage:

	(to remove old packages)
	# apkg-clean -p | xargs rm
	
	(to remove old sources)
	# apkg-clean -s | xargs rm
	
	(to remove both old packages and sources)
	# apkg-clean | xargs rm

apkg-deps
---------

Script to find runtime linked dependencies of installed package. Its good to figure out dependenciess when writing package template.

Usage:
	$ apkg-deps <pkg>

apkg-foreign
------------

Script to list installed package outside package repo.

Usage:

	(print list foreign packages)
	$ apkg-foreign
	
	(remove foreign packages)
	# apkg -r $(apkg-foreign)

apkg-orphan
-----------

Script to print list package without parent dependencies.

Usage:

	$ apkg-orphan

apkg-redundantdeps
------------------

Script to print package's redundant dependencies. Its good to use when writing package template for minimizing dependencies and speed up `apkg` dependencies solving.

usage:

	(print package contains redundant dependencies)
	$ apkg-redundantdeps
	
	(remove redundant dependencies for depends list)
	$ apkg-redundantdeps -f
